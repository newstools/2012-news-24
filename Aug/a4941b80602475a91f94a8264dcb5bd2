POLICE expected to continue enforcing a court order in Howick over the weekend while the strike continues outside the Rema Tip Top-Dunlop factory. Spokesperson Captain Lolly Moodley said early yesterday strikers had tried to stop managers entering the rubber plant and that on Thursday night a car heading for nearby Shiyabazali had been damaged. Moodley added that “about five cases” of strike-related intimidation and damage to property had been opened. Contrary to yesterday’s story, the factory is known as Rema Tip Top-Dunlop, not Sarmcol as reported. On Wednesday, the cars of two managers and the company’s attorney were damaged when the crowd confronted them and entrances to the plant were barricaded, the company said. The following day, a company camera used to monitor the workers’ activities was stolen. “We can only assume this was with a view to removing photographic evidence,” said a director. Management criticised remarks strikers had made to The Witness. A spokesperson said their claim that the company had promised them bonuses, which it had failed to deliver, was false. “We offered performance-based bonuses, which they did not wish to have. They wanted a guaranteed bonus.” The spokesperson also reacted to a remark that there were efforts to sell off the plant to a company in Germany. “We are a German-owned company,” he said. A director refuted claims of corporate corruption in the payment of bonuses. The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) called for evidence to show its members had been involved in violence and intimidation.
