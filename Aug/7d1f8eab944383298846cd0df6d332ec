City Press A WARRANT of arrest was yesterday issued for MP Mandla Mandela. Former president Nelson Mandela’s grandson failed to appear in court over R12 500 maintenance that he was supposed to have paid his first wife, Tando Mabunu-Mandela. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the chief had missed three monthly payments to his estranged wife, and had refused to accept a summons served on him on July 11. Mandela was ordered to pay for the upkeep of his wife while their divorce is finalised. At the weekend, Mandela was in China as a judge at the Miss World beauty contest. It is not clear when he will return to South Africa, and his publicist, Chabo Pelusa, referred all questions to Mandela, who could not be reached immediately. Mabunu-Mandela could also not be reached through her legal representative. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
