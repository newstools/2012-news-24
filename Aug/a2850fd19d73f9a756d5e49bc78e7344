A HOUSE belonging to a supervisor in the strike-torn Dunlop Industrial Products factory was petrol-bombed on Monday morning. Police said no one was injured, but the house was completely destroyed. A case of arson has been opened and police are not discounting the involvement of the striking workers. Police spokesperson, Captain Lolly Moodley said there had been incidents of threats and intimidation reported. Workers distanced themselves from the attacks, but vowed to intensify their protest action until their demands were met. They said they were planning to mobilise community support. They accused management of provoking them by hiring scab labourers and providing security to guard them. Police and private security remained a constant presence outside the factory yesterday. The dispute started last Wednesday with workers demanding a 10% increase in the first year and nine percent in the second year of a two-year contract agreement. Management has offered 5,5%. The workers also want bonuses guaranteed. A senior manager said management was moving towards a performance bonus system because they could not afford guaranteed bonuses due to the ongoing recession. Dunlop Industrial Products is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rema Tip Top Holdings.
