An East Rand police constable reportedly shot dead a police captain in front of his son in an apparent road rage incident at the weekend. The two officials, both of whom were off duty, were involved in a collision near the Katlehong shopping centre on Saturday evening, Beeld reported today. According to police spokesperson Pinky Tsinyane, the men did not know each other, as they worked in different parts of Johannesburg. The 29-year old constable, who was in a white Polo, got out of his car after the collision and confronted the captain, who was in a white Toyota Corolla. “There was a heated exchange, during which the constable allegedly shot the captain, hitting him in the leg,” Tsinyane said. They both returned to their respective vehicles, but the captain, of Brackendowns police station in Alberton, reportedly decided to approach his assailant again, and he ended up assaulting him inside the Polo. According to the deceased’s son, who reportedly witnessed the entire incident, the constable then fired a shot from inside the car, killing the captain. Tsinyane said the constable, of Zonkiziswe police station in Kathlehong, would appear in the Katlehong Magistrates’ Court later today in connection with the murder.
