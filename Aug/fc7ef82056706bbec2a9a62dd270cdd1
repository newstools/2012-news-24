Can Tunisia's fragile economy withstand another delay?" asked opposition MP Issam Chebbi on Monday."We will demand a law that fixes a date for the elections," said the spokesperson for the Republican Party, when contacted by AFP, adding that "the longer the transition lasts, the more the chaos will spread."Kheder said the commission would meet in early September to discuss a "comprehensive timetable" for drafting the new constitution, which has been heavily delayed due to an apparent deadlock over certain key issues.The Islamists in the ruling coalition are pushing for a pure parliamentary system, while the other parties want important powers to remain in the hands of the president.President Moncef Marzouki belongs to the secular centre-left Congress for the Republic, one of Ennahda's coalition partners.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
