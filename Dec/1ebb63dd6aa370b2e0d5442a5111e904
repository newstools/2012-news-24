AN advocate who was convicted of corruption several years ago for accepting a bribe while he was the control prosecutor in Estcourt in 1996 was struck off the roll of advocates in the high court in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. Judges Sharmain Balton and Pete Koen agreed with submissions by the Society of Advocates of KZN that Naveen Rajcoomar ought to be struck off the roll. The grounds raised were that in his unsuccessful application for pupilage in September 2010, he had underplayed the gravity of his conviction by claiming the magistrate who found him guilty did not make any adverse credibility findings against him. “In fact, he found me to be a credible witness,” he said. The high court found that his statement was misleading and that he had not been candid, saying this was clear from the judgment that was handed down by Judge Chris Nicholson, who presided over Rajcoomar’s appeal in 2003. Rajcoomar began serving his sentence of five years’ imprisonment, three of which were conditionally suspended, on October 18, 2004. He was released on parole on July 4, 2005. He was found guilty, together with businessman, Demostenes Antoniades, of corruption for having accepted a R4 000 bribe to make a truck overloading case “disappear”. He was arrested in a police trap.
