Lunga Biyela A TRIP home for a South African emigrant and his wife turned nasty yesterday morning when they had a rock thrown at their car as they drove past Copesville. Michael Parfitt, who emigrated to Australia over a decade ago, had a rock the size of a small soccer ball go through his windscreen. At around 11 am, he told The Witness, “we were driving down the Greytown road, and just before the hill, someone threw a rock at us. It broke our windscreen and it came through and landed in the car.” “We’re here visiting family, and we’re travelling up to Gauteng tomorrow to visit other family members. We’re hoping it will be fixed by then,” he said. Parfitt said they saw three young men on the side of the road. “We were driving slowly because of the holes in the road.” After the rock struck, he drove to a police station and laid a charge. He said the incident had angered him. “First of all, you do feel angry when something like this happens. You think ‘why did they do this to me?’. You’re in a state of shock, but once you recover, you accept it as something that happened in the past.” Parfitt said he had opened a case at Town Hill police station, which was later transfered to Mountain Rise. However, police spokesperson Captain Thulani Zwane said there was no report of a stone throwing incident in their records yesterday. This was the third incident of a car stoning in Pietermawhere in just over a month. Last month, Winton Long escaped with just a scratch when a rock was thrown at his car as he drove along the N3 near the Northdale turnoff. A week later, during Diwali, Sanjay Soni and his family had a concrete slab thrown at their car. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
