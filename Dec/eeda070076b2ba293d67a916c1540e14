 Tehran - Iranian forces have carried out what they called cyber warfare
tactics for the first time as the Islamic republic's naval units staged
manoeuvres in the key Strait of Hormuz, media reports said on Monday. The navy "launched a cyber attack against the computer network of the
defensive forces in order to infiltrate the network and hack information or spread
virus", the English-language Iran daily reported, quoting Rear Admiral
Amir Rastegari. Rastegari said the cyber attack was successfully detected and blocked. Over the past three years, Iranian industrial facilities including oil and
nuclear sites, as well as communications networks and banking systems, have all
come under cyber attacks blamed on the United States and regional arch-foe
Israel. Tehran says it has developed civil and military cyber units to counter such
attacks. Naval forces of the elite Revolutionary Guards have been engaged in a
military drill in the Strait of Hormuz as well as in the Gulf of Oman for the
past week. 'Message of peace' Iranian military officials say the exercises are aimed at demonstrating
Tehran's "defensive naval capabilities... and sending a message of peace
and friendship to regional countries". Submarines are taking part in the drills in which several missile systems
are being tested, Iranian media reported. Military officials have said that the manoeuvres were not aimed at closing
the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway through which much of the world's oil
supply passes. In the past Tehran has repeatedly threatened to block the strait if itâ€™s
vital interests such as nuclear sites are attacked. Israel says it has not ruled out a military strike against Iran's
controversial nuclear programme, which it and the West suspect is aimed at
developing atomic weapons, a charge Tehran denies.  .
At least, on this last day of the year, some good news for the lunatics of the violent left !!!!!
