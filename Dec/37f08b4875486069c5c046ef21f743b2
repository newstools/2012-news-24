Two ANC chairpersons are among a string of senior ANC members who have declined nomination for the partyâ€™s National Executive Committee (NEC). Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe earlier also declined nomination for the NEC, thereby ending his career in the top leadership structures of the party. Others who said no included presidential spokesperson Mac Maharaj, minister in the Presidency Trevor Manuel and struggle stalwart Jay Naidoo. Congress of SA Trade Unions general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, National Union of Metalworkers of SA general secretary Irvin Jim and National Union of Mineworkers general secretary Frans Baleni also did not accept nomination.
