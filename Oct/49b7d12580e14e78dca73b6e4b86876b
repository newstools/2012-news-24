In 30 years we have seen nothing like it," she told state television.Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure before running for president, had published decrees honouring the memory of his predecessor and the army chief of staff at the time, and awarding medals to their families.The Brotherhood had tense relations with Sadat's regime, which granted its leadership figures amnesties but officially banned the movement.In the 1973 surprise offensive, launched on 6 October in the middle of the Jewish Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) religious commemoration, Egyptian troops crossed the Suez Canal for the first time since the 1967 Six-Day War.Despite a counter-offensive that allowed the Israelis to gain the upper hand, the initial attack which caught them by surprise is celebrated with gusto each year by Egyptian authorities.Sadat, vilified by many in the wider Arab world for signing the peace treaty without obtaining concessions for the Palestinians, was killed at a military parade celebrating the 6 October offensive.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
