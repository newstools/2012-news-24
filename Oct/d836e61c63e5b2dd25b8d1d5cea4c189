Thamsanqa Magubane A NEW R45 million taxi and bus rank will be built in Estcourt as part of the KZN Transport Department’s plans to improve public transport infrastructure, the department said yesterday. The rank will be located in the Estcourt CBD and will cater for commuters from 20 areas around the town. Speaking at the sod-turning yesterday, Transport MEC Willies Mchunu said a national household travel survey done in 2003 showed that there was great dissatisfaction with the conditions under which public transport operated. Mchunu said the lack of infrastructure was among the aspects cited for making the public transport system unappealing. He warned people who would be involved in the project not to use it for political mileage.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
