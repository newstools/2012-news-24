But he added that the disease was now under control and confined to the northeastern town of Isiro.In Uganda, Ebola has killed 17 people since July, but officials announced earlier this month that the disease had been brought under control and urged all countries to lift travel restrictions on Uganda.To date, there is no treatment nor vaccine for Ebola, a rare haemorrhagic disease that kills between 25% and 90% of patients, depending on the strain of the virus. It is named after a small river in the DRC. Cholera, which is caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water, can strike swiftly, causing intense diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea that lead to severe dehydration.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
