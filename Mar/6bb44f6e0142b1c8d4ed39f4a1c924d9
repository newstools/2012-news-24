Philip de Bruin ADVOCATE Willem Heath said yesterday he has yet to receive a summons from former president Thabo Mbeki. Sunday newspapers reported that Mbeki was intending to sue Heath for libel following earlier pronouncements he had made about Mbeki’s alleged involvement in the prosecution of President Jacob Zuma. In an interview shortly after Zuma had appointed Heath as the head of the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) special investigation unit at the end of November 2011, Heath said Mbeki, who was still head of state at the time, had “orchestrated” the rape and corruption charges against Zuma. A public outcry followed the announcement, which led to Heath’s resigning of his own accord only 17 days after the appointment. Heath said Mbeki “dictated” to the NPA regarding the rape case against Zuma. Zuma was later acquitted on the charge by Judge Willem van der Merwe. All corruption charges against Zuma were subsequently dropped by the NPA. A ruling by five appeal court judges relating to this decision by the NPA is expected in the next few days. Heath denied yesterday that he had said he refused to withdraw the allegations against Mbeki “because it was in the public interest”. “That is not correct. I will make no comment at this stage, because everything is very confused.” According to yesterday’s report Heath’s and Mbeki’s legal teams are involved in discussions to try to find a solution that will satisfy both parties. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
