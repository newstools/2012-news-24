POLICE had no other choice but to place suspended procurement officer Colonel Navin Madhoe back on duty, spokesperson Colonel Jay Naicker said yesterday. Naicker said the disciplinary case against Madhoe, which had been pending for eight months, had been put on hold at the request of the prosecution in the criminal case as it might affect the outcome. “In terms of our disciplinary regulations, a member may only be on suspension for not more than three months pending the finalisation of the disciplinary trial. “In this case, the member was suspended for eight months and we were forced to place him back on duty.” Naicker said Madhoe had been moved to the Inanda police cluster, where he is in an “operational capacity”. Madhoe was suspended after allegations that he and Umhlanga businessman Thoshan Panday tried to bribe embattled KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Johan Booysen with R1,3 million to backdate a report on an investigation of a R60 million police accommodation tender scam in which both men are suspects. Madhoe’s attorney, Ravindra Maniklal, said he was aware that his client was back at work. Maniklal said he and Madhoe would not say more than that. A source told The Witness that there were “too many coincidences”, with Madhoe returning to work on the same day the alleged Cato Manor “hit squad” members were suspended. However, he said, there was “no provision in regulations to hold disciplinary in abeyance of criminal matter”. “Technically Madhoe is correct because SAPS don’t adhere to [its] own regulations,” he said. He also said he was aware that Panday had reopened his R17 million claim for services rendered to the police.
