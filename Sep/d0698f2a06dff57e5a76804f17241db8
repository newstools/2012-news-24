He had not been seen in public for two months, spurring rumours about his health.The former rebel turned regional strongman took power in 1991 after toppling dictator Mengistu Hailemariam, remaining at the helm of Ethiopia - a relatively stable country in the volatile Horn of Africa region - until his death.But while he was credited with bringing about widespread economic growth, rights groups criticised him for what they said was a crackdown on opposition groups and journalists.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
