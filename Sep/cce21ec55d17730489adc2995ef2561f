"But we quickly realised it could be something else."While declining to make a direct connection between the murders and the victims' profession, Badege acknowledged that it was a "trend" and that all avenues were being investigated."I know women who have been killed. I was with one of them just an hour beforehand," said a 28-year-old prostitute who gave her name as Eugenia and lives not far from the scene of the latest murders in the Gastata district. "Now I'm afraid to go to work. Before these murders there was no problem, we felt safe. I used to get home by 22:00, now I try to get back before sunset."Local authorities in the affected areas have boosted security, with guards paid by residents patrolling the streets day and night, while meetings are being held to raise awareness about the murders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
