Thandiwe JumoTHE first day of school brings about a lot of anxiety and fears for parents and children. No one knows this better than Laura Geething, mother of triplets Brett, Ross and Gina, who will be starting grade one today.&ldquo;When I saw them in their uniform I had tears in my eyes and I have a feeling that I will be crying even more when I return home after dropping them off.&ldquo;When I found out I was carrying triplets I was shocked and scared, but seeing them grow up has been such a wonderful experience. Letting them go off is going to be very hard for me,&rdquo; said Geething.The boys will be going to Merchiston Preparatory School, while their sister will be going to St Johns Diocesan School for Girls, a split which the Geething siblings seem blissfully unaware of as they happily played together yesterday.However, Brett is worried about being dirty and stinky after playtime.This is until his brother Ross reminded him that school is a place of learning.&ldquo;I am excited about going to school, but I am not happy that we only get a shorter play time,&rdquo; said Brett, while struggling to free himself of his school tie.For mother of 14-year-old quadruplets Yolanda de Lange, seeing her daughters Abigail and Debralee as well as sons Jaydon and Jared starting high school is a joyous occasion with worrying financial implications.&ldquo;The cost factor of having them all in high school at once is very stressful. I am really grateful that I have managed to bring them so far and I know that God will provide,&rdquo; she said.Dressed in their Maritzburg College uniforms, the boys reminisced about how they had confused teachers in the past.&ldquo;Remember when we used pretend to be each other and fool our grade five teachers. That was fun, but I don&rsquo;t think we will be doing that any more this year,&rdquo; said Jared to his brother Jaydon.The girls, on the other hand, are thrilled about going to Pietermaritzburg Girls High with most of their friends and without their brothers.&ldquo;We are so happy to be separated from our brothers because they are so annoying. We are nervous and excited about high school, but at least we will be together with our friends,&rdquo; said Abigail.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
