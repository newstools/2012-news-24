They wanted to make sure that racism is finished in South Africa and it is very sad that we are still on that tag of racism."While Balindlela is no longer considered a major player in South African politics, her defection will be a blow to the already underfire ANC.It will also provide a boost to the DA, which has often struggled to win over black voters.Balindlela was pushed from her post as Eastern Cape leader in 2008 after her province opposed Jacob Zuma's successful bid to oust Thabo Mbeki from the presidency.She later joined the Congress of the People that split from the ANC four years ago.DA leader Helen Zille lauded the move."Many of us understand that our future lies in transcending these obsolete political formations. But it takes a courageous person to be among the first to show the way to others."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
