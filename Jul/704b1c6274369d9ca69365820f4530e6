Three members of a family, including two children, were killed when their car plunged into the Richards Bay harbour. The Witness reported that a father and his two young sons were declared dead at yesterday’s scene. “Police divers were dispatched to the scene and recovered the bodies of an adult male and two young boys,” police spokesperson Colonel Jay Naicker told the newspaper. Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said paramedics had tried to revive the children but failed. It was estimated that they had been in the water for about 20 minutes. The family had apparently attempted to gain access to the back of the port at 1pm, but were turned away by a security guard. The guard said they returned an hour later without the mother, and went over the edge and into the water. The mother was expected to be questioned by authorities today.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
