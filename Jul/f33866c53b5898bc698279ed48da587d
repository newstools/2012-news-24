Johannesburg - All major roads, apart from Swartberg Pass between Oudtshoorn and Prince Albert, were safe and open to traffic on Monday, a Western Cape official said.The N1, N2 and N7 from Cape Town to Beaufort West, Storms River and Van Rhynsdorp had been cleared for traffic flow, said transport spokespersonAl-Ameen Kafaar.Also open were Route 62, connecting Worcester, Oudtshoon and Uniondale; Du Toitskloof Pass, between Paarl and Worcester; Mitchell's Pass near Ceres; Meiringspoort, between Beaufort West and Oudtshoorn; and the Mossel Bay-Oudtshoorn Pass.Swartberg Pass was still closed due to snowfalls. Its reopening would largely depend on weather conditions, said Kafaar."The inclement and heavy weather did not cause any significant road infrastructure damage."He said debris on the N2 at Sir Lowry's Pass near Somerset West, caused by rock falls, had not yet been removed."The boulders are too big to be removed by conventional methods. That part of the N2 has been cordoned off. There is normal traffic flow on the rest of the N2."Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said on Monday morning that the rocks were blocking between one and two lanes, with traffic redirected through one open lane."A few of the rocks are the size of cars," he said.According to the Cape Times, two cars had been hit by some of the rocks. Twelve people, including six children, sustained scratches and bruises.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
