TWO people were crushed to death under heavy gates and a third was seriously injured within hours of each other in separate freak accidents on Friday, July 13. In the first incident, a security guard at a factory in the Phoenix industrial area was killed after a steel gate, weighing some 300 kg, fell on him on Friday evening. Jeffrey Wicks, spokesperson for Netcare 911, said the cause of the accident was not known. It seems as if the gate moved off its railing and tumbled over the guard while he was pulling it open. Paramedics declared him dead on the scene, said Wicks. In another incident on Friday evening, a man on the East Rand died when the electrical security gate at his plot in Benoni pinned him against a wall. Vanessa Jackson, spokesperson for ER24, said the 32-year-old man was found dead on the scene after his family called the paramedics at 5.15 pm. André Visser, Jakson’s colleague, said a second East Rand man was seriously injured on Friday night in Kempton Park after a 300 kg gate fell on him. The 57-year-old was standing next to the gate when it derailed and fell on his head, causing suspected neck and back injuries.
