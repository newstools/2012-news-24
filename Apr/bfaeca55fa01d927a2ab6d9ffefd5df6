Kigali - A top Rwandan opposition leader says she has withdrawn from a trial in which she faces charges of terrorism, citing a lack of judiciary independence.Victoire Ingabire said on Monday she has "totally lost trust" in the judicial system. She says she will not report to court any more to answer to charges she alleges are politically motivated.Ingabire, who is facing charges related to threatening state security, genocide denial and promoting ethnic division, has been in detention since October 2010. She returned to Rwanda in January 2010 to participate in presidential elections.State Prosecution described Ingabire's decision as "absurd and untimely." Rwanda's Deputy Prosecutor Alphonse Hitiyaremye says Ingabire was done with her defence, but the prosecution still has to present a response. He says they will carry on with the case, despite her withdrawal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
